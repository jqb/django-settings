django-settings
===============

Forked from https://github.com/jqb/django-settings to allow use in Django 2.x / Python 3.x


Supported versions
------------------

* Python: 3.6
* Django: 2.2


API
---

IMPORTANT: changed in version 1.3, old api still works but caching do not work with it.


.. code-block:: python

  import django_settings

  # getting values
  # this will raise django_settings.models.Setting.DoesNotExist
  # exception if value not exists
  # if value is not in cache it will be cached
  django_settings.get('post_limit')

  # if you not sure value exists you can pass "default" parameter,
  # at this point default is NOT cached
  django_settings.get('post_limit', default=10)

  # set values - cache is updated for "get" and "exists" method
  # values are validated using setting_value model clean_fields method
  django_settings.set('Email', 'admin_email', 'admin@admin.com')

  # If you want to avoid validation, do this:
  django_settings.set('Email', 'admin_email', 'admin@admin.com', validate=False)

  # checking if value exists
  django_settings.exists('admin_email')

  # getting all values as a dict
  django_settings.all()


Or in templates


.. code-block:: python

  {% load settings_tags %}

  Current post limit is {% settings "post_limit" %}

  or

  {% settings "post_limit" as post_limit %}
  Current post limit is {{ post_limit }}


Installation & setup
--------------------

1) Install it using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> pip install django-settings


2) Add "django_settings" to your INSTALLED_APPS

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',  # contenttypes framework is required

        # ...

        'django_settings',

        # ...
    )


3) If you want to add your own settings models, please add them in one of your
   applications models file, and register them with django_settings api:

.. code-block:: python

   # <project>/<app>/models.py
   from django.db import models


   # ... your application models


   import django_settings

   class Text(django_settings.db.Model):
       value = models.TextField()
       class Meta:
           abstract = True   # it's IMPORTANT - it need to be abstract
   django_settings.register(Text)


Remember to define model as abstract, this is important because of how django
treats model classes.


There is ability to setup some defaults via project settings.py file.
Those settings will be setup ONLY if they not already exists in db.

.. code-block:: python

   DJANGO_SETTINGS = {
      'application_limit': ('Integer', 2),
      'admin_email': ('String', 'admin@mail.com'),
   }


For import DJANGO_SETTINGS into database use command:

.. code-block:: python

    ./manage.py settings_initialize


Default django-settings timeout is set to 1 day, but it can be changed
in your project settings:

.. code-block:: python

   DJANGO_SETTINGS_TIMEOUT = 60 * 60 * 10  # 10 hours


Timeout let's you define cache timeout (in sec.) for each of the
settings. After the given time values gets expired and each of them
will be recalculated (at the moment you ask for the given
setting). Introduced due to django's defaults cache timeout (5 min):
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/#cache-arguments
